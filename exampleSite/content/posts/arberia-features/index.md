Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 

### Intro

- **We'll be using `toml` format for all examples down below, I recommend using `toml` as it is easier to read.**

- You can find any [YML to TOML](https://www.google.com/search?q=yml+to+toml) converters if necessary.

---

### Assets (js/css)

The following is enabled by default

- [minification](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/minification/) - makes the assets size smallest as possible.
- [bundling](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/bundling/) - bundles all the styles in one single asset
- [fingerprint/intergity](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/fingerprint/) check.

### Search Page

PaperMod uses [flexsearch.js](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) for search functionality

Add the following to site config, `config.toml`

```toml
[outputs]
  home = ["HTML", "JSON", "RSS", "AMP"] # is necessary
  page = ["HTML"]
  section = ["HTML", "RSS"]
  taxonomy = ["HTML", "RSS"]
```

Create a page with `search/_index.md` in `content` directory with following content

```toml
---
title: Search
subtitle: Search index

draft: false
weight: 

type: search #is necessary
layout: "search" #is necessary

categories:
  - search

hiddenFromHomePage: true
hiddenFromSearch: true

resources:
  - name: featured-image
    src: ""
  - name: featured-image-preview
    src: ""

featured: false

toc: false
math:
  enable: false
lightgallery: false

```
---

<!-- To hide a particular page from being searched, add it in post's frontmatter

```yml
---
searchHidden: true
``` -->


### Draft Page indication

adds `[draft]` mark to indicate draft pages.

---

### Post Cover Image

In post's page-variables add :

```toml
resources:
- name: "featured-image"
  src: "insert image path here"
- name: "featured-image-preview"
  src: "insert image path here"
```

When you include images in the [Page Bundle](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/), multiple sizes of the image will automatically be provided using the HTML5 `srcset` field.

To reduce generation time and size of the site, you can disable this feature using

```toml
[params.resources]
responsiveImages = false

```

To enable hyperlinks to the full image size on post pages, use

```toml
[params.resources]
linkFullImages = true
```

---

### Share Buttons on post

to show share buttons add in config/params.toml

```toml
[social.share]
    enable = true
```
---

### Show Table of Contents (Toc) on blog post

To show ToC add following to page-variables

```tolm
toc: true # Works only with standard-view
```
---

### Enhanced SEO

<!-- **Enabled only when `env: production`**

- [Rich Results/Snippets Support](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7506797?hl=en) -->

#### Twitter Cards Support

<!-- * The Twitter Cards metadata, except ``twitter:image`` should not require
  additional configuration, since it is generated from metadata that
  you should already have (for instance the page title and description).
* The ``twitter:image`` uses the [Post Cover Image](#post-cover-image), if present.
* In the absence of a cover images, the first image from the ``images``
  frontmatter (a list) is used.
  ```yaml
  images:
    - image_01.png
    - image_02.png
  ```
* Finally, if neither of those are provided, ``twitter:image`` comes from the first
  [Page Bundle](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/)
  image with ``feature`` in the name, with a fallback to the first image with
  ``cover`` or ``thumbnail`` in the name. -->

#### OpenGraph support

<!-- * The OpenGraph metadata, except ``og:image`` should not require
  additional configuration, since it is generated from metadata that
  you should already have (for instance the page title and description).
* The ``og:image`` uses the [Post Cover Image](#post-cover-image), if present.
* In the absence of a cover images, the first image from the ``images``
  frontmatter (a list) is used.
  ```yaml
  images:
    - image_01.png
    - image_02.png
  ```
* Finally, if neither of those are provided, ``og:image`` comes from the first
  [Page Bundle](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/)
  image with ``feature`` in the name, with a fallback to the first image with
  ``cover`` or ``thumbnail`` in the name.
* For pages, you can also add audio (using frontmatter ``audio: filename.ext``) and/or
  videos.
  ```yaml
  videos:
    - filename01.mov
    - filename02.avi -->
  ```
