This is a **video post view** example.

Do you, like me, find yourself stuck at home these days and are looking to learn something new? Then come with me to learn 3D modeling with Solidworks.
While you learn 3D modeling, I learn how to record and edit small video tutorials. As you can see, it is still an equal exchange. To record the screen I am using OBS and to edit the videos I am familiarazing with DaVinci Resolve.

My tutorials are far from perfect and for this reason I would like your criticisms to be also harsh but sincere. I therefore ask you to report any errors or unclear concepts in the comments and I will do my best to improve in the next round.

In this series of 5 videos we model a support for a tree consisting of two parts:

- the lower support
- the upper shell

In the first video we model the lower support and you will learn how to use the 2D Sketch tools and the Extrude and Hole Wizard functions;
In the second we model the upper support that I call the shell you will reinforce the use of the tools of the first video.

In the third video we will compose the assembly to check if there is any interference between the pieces.
In the fourth and fifth video we will prepare the individual pieces on the table. We will learn how to use the Smart Dimension tool, fill in the Title Block and produce the printable sheet in PDF.

To follow the first tutorial on Solidworks **I suggest you download PDF drawing** I created for you. Follow this link and start the exercise:
